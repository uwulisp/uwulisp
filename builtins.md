## Arithmetic

### `+`
Sums zero or more numbers.

```
(+ n1 n2 ...)  →  Number
```

Returns `0` when called with no arguments.

---

### `-`
Subtracts numbers. With a single argument, negates it.

```
(- n)           →  Number   ; negation
(- n1 n2 ...)   →  Number   ; subtraction
```

Requires at least one argument.

---

### `*`
Multiplies zero or more numbers.

```
(* n1 n2 ...)  →  Number
```

Returns `1` when called with no arguments.

---

### `/`
Divides the first number by each subsequent number.

```
(/ n1 n2 ...)  →  Number
```

Requires at least one argument. Raises an error on division by zero.

---

## Comparisons

All numeric comparisons take exactly two number arguments and return `1.0` for true, `0.0` for false.

### `print`
Prints each argument separated by spaces, followed by a newline, then returns an empty list.

```

```

Strings are printed as raw text (without surrounding quotes); all other values use their debug representation.

---

## Cubical Type Theory

These builtins provide a surface-level Lisp API over the internal cubical type theory (CTT) kernel. Every cubical builtin returns an `Expr::CubicalTerm` wrapping the corresponding `Term` variant. Arguments that are expected to be cubical terms must themselves be `Expr::CubicalTerm` values.

### Interval Atoms

```

No arguments.

```
(interval-join a b)  →  TCube(dnf)

```

Same constraints as `interval-meet`.
