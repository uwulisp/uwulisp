//! A minimal mark-and-sweep garbage collector for `EnvData` nodes.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! Every environment is stored inside a `Heap` as a pair of parallel
//! arrays, indexed by slot:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Heap.data: [ Some(EnvData), None,        Some(EnvData), ... ]
//!   Heap.meta: [ {generation: 0, ..},  {generation: 3, ..}, {generation: 1, ..},  ... ]
//! ```
//!
//! `data[i]` is `None` exactly when slot `i` is free. `meta[i].generation` is a
//! counter that increments every time slot `i` is *reused* by `alloc`,
//! independent of whether `data[i]` currently holds anything — this is
//! the key piece that lets us detect stale handles (see below).
//!
//! A `GcHandle` is `{ idx, generation }`: an index into those arrays plus the
//! generation it was issued at. It is `Copy` and has no destructor, so
//! it can live inside `Expr::Lambda` without any reference counting.
//! Both fields are private — the only way to obtain a `GcHandle` is via
//! `Heap::alloc`, so code outside this module can't conjure up an
//! arbitrary/out-of-thin-air handle.
//!
//! ## Allocation
//! `Heap::alloc` pops an index off a free-list if one exists (O(1)),
//! bumping that slot's generation; otherwise it grows the arrays.
//!
//! ## Stale handles vs. dangling handles
//! Two distinct failure modes are both detected, with distinct-ish
//! messages:
//! * **Freed, not yet reused** (`data[i] == None`) — same as before,
//!   "the slot was swept."
//! * **Reused by something else** (`data[i] == Some(..)` but
//!   `meta[i].generation != handle.generation`) — this is the dangerous case a plain
//!   `usize` handle can't distinguish: the index is alive, but it's
//!   *not the same environment* the handle was originally issued for.
//!   Without the generation counter this would silently return the
//!   wrong `EnvData` instead of erroring.
//!
//! Out-of-range indices (handle never allocated, or heap was somehow
//! given a handle from a different `Heap`) are also handled explicitly
//! via `.get()`, so they produce the same friendly panic message
//! instead of a raw "index out of bounds."
//!
//! ## Mark phase
//! The caller passes a set of *root* handles (the currently-reachable
//! environments — e.g. the global env and every env on the eval call
//! stack). `Heap::mark` walks each root's `parent` chain, and also walks
//! *into* every `Expr` stored in `vars` looking for `Expr::Lambda`
//! values — including ones nested inside `Expr::List`, the bodies of
//! other lambdas, and `Expr::Macro` bodies — not just top-level values.
//! Each lambda found contributes its captured-env `GcHandle` as
//! something to mark.
//!
//! The *heap-graph* walk (parent links, lambda-to-lambda chains) uses an
//! explicit work stack rather than recursion, since that graph can be
//! arbitrarily deep/cyclic. The *Expr-tree* walk inside a single value
//! is also an explicit stack (see `collect_lambda_envs`), for safety
//! against deeply nested ASTs.
//!
//! A handle that turns out to be out-of-range, freed, or stale while
//! walking is *not* a normal occurrence — `roots` should only ever
//! contain handles that are still genuinely alive — so hitting one is
//! treated as a bug and flagged via `debug_assert!` (loud in debug
//! builds, but the release build stays lenient and just skips it rather
//! than crashing the collector itself).
//!
//! ## Sweep phase
//! `Heap::sweep` iterates all slots. Any slot with `marked == false` is
//! freed (`data[i]` set to `None`, index pushed onto the free-list).
//! All remaining slots are then unmarked, ready for the next cycle.
//!
//! ## Compaction (optional)
//! We do *not* compact by default, so the `idx` half of a `GcHandle`
//! remains stable forever. Freed slots are reused by `alloc` via the
//! free-list (O(1) instead of the old O(n) first-fit scan).
